# Can AI-Generated Text be Reliably Detected?
### Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11156

This repository contains codes for reproducing our results on paraphrasing attacks, impossibility results, and spoofing attacks. Please see requirements.txt for Python libraries that are needed. To reproduce our attacks on text watermarks, clone the repository from https://github.com/jwkirchenbauer/lm-watermarking.git to this folder. Clone https://github.com/martiansideofthemoon/ai-detection-paraphrases/ to perform experiments using DIPPER paraphraser.

rephrase/ contains the paraphrasing attacks.<br/>
impossibilty/ contains codes for visualizing our theoretical results.<br/>
pair-distribution/ contains codes for spoofing atttacks.<br/>
